TODO:

1. Check if error is related to reward func or to num_envs - It is related to get_current_TCP_pose() well yes but it was GPU memory issues due to too many parallel environments
2. Solve error
3. Check reward weights




Yet not many sim-to-real efforts for assembly (mostly for locomotion and manipulation) \cite{SimToRealTransferInDeepRL}
